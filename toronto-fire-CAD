# From https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/alerts-notifications/toronto-fire-active-incidents/ :
#
#  The following active incidents are dispatched from Toronto Fire Services
#  Communication Centre. The contents are updated at five minute intervals
#  from the CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) system.
#
# https://www.toronto.ca/data/fire/livecad.xml is the machine-readable
# version of the tabular information at the first link.  Apparently the
# update frequency is "every five minutes", so let's assume we're polling
# every 2.5 minutes (though of course this will be up to the cron job to
# actually implement).
#
# The result will be a directory of pairs of files (XML and headers)
# unique per retrieval but potentially duplicated in time.  This program
# should thus be complemented by a second half which iterates over that
# structure to pull out status updates and potentially populate a nicely
# queryable database.
